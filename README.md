# OS Simulator
This project is a visualization of batch processing in an operating system. Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects similar jobs together in a batch and then starts executing the batches sequentially, one job at a time. In a multi-programmed batch system, the CPU will never be idle. The Operating System keeps multiple jobs in the main memory, these are the jobs waiting to be executed. The Operating System will choose one of these jobs and begins execution. Once this job needs an I/O operation, the Operating System switches to another job. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the Operating System chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling.

## Project Objective
The best way to understand the concepts of an Operating System is to build an operating system and then to experiment with it. This OS will be a SIMULATION only. In this project, we were asked to build a simulation of a multi-programming batch system using **JAVA**.

## Note
This is a university (GUC) course project. Course name is (CSEN 602 : Operating Systems). For a detailed description of the project and its requirements, please have a look at the [description](Description) folder.
